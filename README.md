 1. [Information Gathering](https://github.com/UmutErgunes/EthicalHacking/blob/master/InformationGathering.md)
     * We gonna collect all the information about our target from different sources.
     * You can find information active and passive.
 2. Scanning
     * We will scan our target
     * We are going to look for 3 things: Ports, Network & Vulnerability.
 3. Gaining Access
     * Choose your Tool and Exploit 
     * Increase your privilege to Administrator 
 4. Maintaining Access
     * Keep the Access for Future Exploitation and Attacks
     * Open a Backdoor

     * Delete Logs, Installed Programs, Registry, etc.
     * No evidence = No proof
