### Definition 'Ethical Hacking'
The term "white hat" in Internet slang refers to an ethical computer hacker, <br>
or a computer security expert, who specializes in penetration testing and <br>
in other testing methodologies that ensures the security of an organization's information systems


### How To Start?
Before we get into Ethical Hacking, we need to have a basic understanding of a few things. These are,<br>
#### Rules: 
 - Always obtain permission before testing a security
 - We don't break or steal, We Test!
 - Respect the privacy of the other
 - Think like <b>Black Hat</b> hackers and solve the problems like <b>White Hat</b>
 
#### Basic knowledge about:
 - HTML,CSS & JS
 - Programming & scripting
 - Linux Environment (Commands)
 - Routing & Switching


Now we can start. There are steps that I always follow.

### Step-by-step
 I always take notes and I also strongly recommend everyone to take notes. <br>
 What you do, how you did, what did you find, where did you find, etc. <br>
 Note everything in Notepad or Cherrytree in Kali Linux. <br>
 
 1. Information Gathering
     * The most important step. Here we are going to collect all the information from different sources.
     * You can find information active and passive.
 2. Scanning
     * We will scan our target
     * We are going to look for 3 things: Ports, Network & Vulnerability.
 3. Gaining Access
     * Choose your Tool and Exploit 
     * Increase your privilege to Administrator
